### Revenue Forecasting

```markdown
User Request:
"Generate a revenue forecast for Q2 2026"

Forecast Input:
- Current MRR: $10,000
- Current customers: 12
- Current churn rate: 3%
- Average deal size: $25,000/year
- Seasonal factors: Q2 typically 20% higher (new budget cycles)

Forecast Model: Linear Trend + Seasonal Adjustment

Q1 Actual: $25,000
Q2 Forecast: $30,000 (+20% seasonal) × 3% churn factor = $29,100
Q3 Forecast: $32,000 (+7% trend) × 2% churn = $31,360
Q4 Forecast: $35,000 (+9% trend) × 2% churn = $34,300

Total Q2: $29,100
Confidence: 85%

Breakdown:
- Existing customers: $28,000 (Q1 + growth)
- New deals Q2: $1,100 (estimated 44 prospects × 2.5% win rate × $25k)
- Churn impact: -$300 (12 customers × $25k × 3% × 33% churn)

Key Risks:
- ⚠️ Seasonal variability
- ⚠️ Enterprise deal uncertainty
- ⚠️ Budget timing risk

Actions:
- Focus on upsell to existing accounts (higher conversion)
- Accelerate deal cycle (reduce from 16 to 12 weeks)
- Early pipeline filling (ensure steady deal flow)

Analytics:
- Pipeline velocity: $25k/week average
- Conversion rate: 2.5% lead to qualified, 25% qualified to proposal

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Lead scoring not accurate

**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient training data
- Outdated scoring model
- Feature mismatch
- Industry bias in scoring

**Solutions:**
1. Retrain model: `sales-skill --retrain-scoring`
2. Update features: Review and adjust weights
3. A/B test new model: `sales-skill --test-scoring-model`
4. Monitor accuracy: Track conversion by score quintile
5. Add manual overrides: Allow sales reps to adjust scores

### Issue: Pipeline blocked

**Possible causes:**
- Resource constraints (limited sales reps)
- Technical dependencies (waiting on product features)
- Market conditions (budget freezes)
- Stakeholder availability
- Process bottlenecks

**Solutions:**
1. Unblock dependencies: Prioritize with product team
2. Resource allocation: Consider hiring or contractor
3. Process optimization: Remove unnecessary steps
4. Market adaptation: Adjust messaging for budget-conscious buyers
5. Timeline management: Set expectations with customers

### Issue: Forecast accuracy declining

**Possible causes:**
- Market volatility increased
- Competitive landscape changed
- Customer churn higher than expected
- New product pricing
- Sales process changes

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce forecast horizon: `sales-skill --forecast-horizon=6` (from 12 months)
2. Adjust model: `sales-skill --switch-model=arima` (time series)
3. Add external factors: Incorporate market data
4. Increase scenario planning: Best/worst/most likely cases
5. Monitor real-time: Update forecasts based on actuals
